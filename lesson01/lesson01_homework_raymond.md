# Homework

## My brainstorming

Last year we had some moments of glory and some moments of sadness. Our homework was to brainstorm ways to prevent those
moments happening, and here are some I thought of;

*1. We use a gryo senser and round off to the nearest degree (90, 180, 270) so we're straight and then avoid it. This will insure
that our code is more accurate, though here are the downsides. Firstly, if it's already wonky then it might count the 'degrees'
from where it's facing, meaning it would all the more be off track. We will not be using this because of that, even Rachel hadn't
approved it!

*2. We can use last years code with the 'turn till right sensor sees black' requirement with it. This code has worked the best so far but one problem still lays in its tracks like a wall for both these codes...

## The BIG Problem

The problem and maybe even possibly one of the reasons we didn't win in 2019 was because of the 'sloping ultrasonic sensor'. As you can
already see by the name, it suggests that the ultrasonic sensor was sloping down, meaning if the 'rescue grounds' had even one uneven hill
or 'basically if it wasn't flat' then it would see that and think there was a obstacle when there wasn't. This became worse in the last 2 rounds with the robot turning around, moving forward, going of track, when there wasn't a obstacle. We've decided that the ultrasonic sensor needs a firm hold and that it ALWAYS FACES FORWARD! If we can do that, then this 'problem' will become a 'problem' of the past!
