# GitHub
We started the lesson today by learning how to save to GitHub (again)
After uploading our notes and homework to GitHub, we had to decide on team, and robot names.
All of us (me and Raymond) tried to connect to the brick, failing on the first few tries, but finally establishing a secure connection.
We whiteboarded other peoples code logic for the Avoid_Object segment and how well they would work.
we all tried to guess who's code would work the best (taking a vote) Frank won in the vote, as well as the round system.
we spent the rest of the afternoon updating and testing our own codes, ultimately, wedecided to use Frank's code logic.
