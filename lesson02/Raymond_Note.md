# Lesson 2 SUmmary for homework

What we did for lesson two was we read about the rules of the robocup competition to clarify and be prepared for the
requirements. Other than that we also tested the 2019 code and also reviewed it, thinking of ways to make it better.
The avoid object was a peculiar part of the code that we had to improve. We had to brainstorm ideads though it was hard as
we had to decide either to use 'hard coded' code or 'robust coded' code which was tough as 'robust coded' code meant that we 
would have to think even more than outside the box, maybe even outside this world! Though with the 'hard coded' code it wasn't
as accurate and successful as it could be. A suggestion that I made was to use a gryo sensor to measure the angles to peform a
more accurate and successful preformance. It might just as well work :D (I haven't tried yet!)
