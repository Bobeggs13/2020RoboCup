# Evaluation

## What have I learned?
* How Colour Sensors work having a LED projecting the light to reflect off a surface
to see the reflected light intensity
* You can secure and improve your robot by framing the outside for extra support
* The best designs are usually stable and compact
* Make a shield that can fit against the Colour Sensors so that if you're using 
reflected light intensity there will be no interference from ambient light
* Ways to compare variable to other parameters or inputs to have a output of 
advanced things (Wall avoiding, etc)

## Code
Based off of the Wall Avoiding video I have created my own code for this agenda
and assume to test it. The eventuality might turn out bad though it's those steps
every coder has to take! If you're asking the code name is D and it is the exact same code
from the video though modified

## Mistakes I made
* To make the format you have to make sure you have a md at the end of the file name
* Make sure that file name has no spaces. 
* Use preview mode before submit.
